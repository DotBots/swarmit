 # SwarmIT

 SwarmIT provides nRF53 compatible embedded C and Python based services to
 easily build and deploy a robotic swarm infrastructure testbed.
 ARM TrustZone is used to create a sandboxed user environment on each device
 under test, without requiring a control co-processor attached to it.

## Features

- Experiment management: configure, start and stop
- Deploy a custom firmware on all robots of a swarm testbed
- Resilient robot state, even when crashed by buggy user code
